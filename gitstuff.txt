IF YOU ARE WORKING WITH VISUAL STUDIO
AND GIT LENS YOU HAVE TO ADD THIS LINE
IN THE ~/.gitconfig file
[diff]
    tool = vscode
[difftool "vscode"]
    cmd = code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE
if you want, you can also add this to use VSCODE for merge !

[merge]
    tool = vscode
[mergetool "vscode"]
    cmd = code --wait $MERGED

//view changes on fast forward commits and see what was MERGED
git log --oneline --graph --decorate

//REMOVE BRANCHES
git branch -d "branch"

//TESTING BRANCHES AGAIN
